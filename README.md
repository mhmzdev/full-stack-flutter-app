### Full Stack Social Media App (in-progress)
Trying to develop full-stack flutter application with `dart_frog` as backend

- client/
    - it's the flutter app
- server/
    - it's the `dart` server
    - packages/db
        - it's the package talking to the `postgres`
    - packages/shared
        - it's the shared code base among server and client, the purpose of using dart as backend and flutter on front-end is justified here.
